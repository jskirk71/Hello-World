# Hello-World
My first repository

Jason here.  I'm a big Cheifs fan.  Was extremely happy for my team this year after they won their first super bowl in 50 years.  Also, I'm a research scientist interested in learning how to code in R.  Have a lovely wife, 2 amazing kids, and some dogs that are okay.  ;)
